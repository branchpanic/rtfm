> Mod documentation that just works. Press CTRL for more info.

RTFM is a project that aims to give modders and modpack an avenue for documentation that "just works." In more concrete
terms, this means:

- No hard dependency on RTFM is required, ever.
- No code is required to add rich documentation to items and blocks.
- Documentation is written in plain Markdown and stored in data packs.
